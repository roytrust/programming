### What is AI?
Simply put, AI is the creation of software that imitates human behaviors and capabilities. Key workloads include:

* Machine learning - This is often the foundation for an AI system, and is the way we "teach" a computer model to make prediction and draw conclusions from data.
* Anomaly detection - The capability to automatically detect errors or unusual activity in a system.
* Computer vision - The capability of software to interpret the world visually through cameras, video, and images. For example: image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, image analysis, face detection-analysis-recognition, OCR (optical character recognition)
* Natural language processing - The capability for a computer to interpret written or spoken language, and respond in kind.
* Knowledge mining - The capability to extract information from large volumes of often unstructured data to create a searchable knowledge store.

### How machine learning works
* Data scientists can use all of that data to train machine learning models that can make predictions and inferences based on the relationships they find in the data.
* 

### Computer Vision
* Describing an image
* Tagging visual features
* Detecting objects: identify and locate specific types of object in an image or camera feed. Return a class label, probability, and bounding box for each ojbect in the image.
* Detecting brands
* Detecting faces
* Categorizing an image
* Detecting domain-specific content
* Optical character recognition
* Detect image types. Detect image color schemes. Generate thumbnails. Moderate content.
