## Linear Algebra
* [Python notebook](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2/blob/master/math_linear_algebra.ipynb)
* Studies vector spaces and linear transformations between vector spaces.

### Vectors
* A *vector* is a quantity defined by a magnitude and a direction.
* Purpose in ML: represent observations and predictions.

### Norm
* The *norm* of a vector u, noted ||u||, is a measure of the length (a.k.a. the magnitude) of u.
