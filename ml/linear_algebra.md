## Linear Algebra
* [Python notebook](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2/blob/master/math_linear_algebra.ipynb)
* Studies vector spaces and linear transformations between vector spaces.

### Vectors
* A *vector* is a quantity defined by a magnitude and a direction.
* Purpose in ML: represent observations and predictions.

### Norm
* The norm of a vector $\\textbf{u}$, noted $\\left \\Vert \\textbf{u} \\right \\|$, is a measure of the length (a.k.a. the magnitude) of $\\textbf{u}$.
* The norm of a vector $\textbf{u}$, noted $\left \Vert \textbf{u} \right \|$, is a measure of the length (a.k.a. the magnitude) of $\textbf{u}$
