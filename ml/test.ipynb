    "## Norm\n",
    "The norm of a vector $\\textbf{u}$, noted $\\left \\Vert \\textbf{u} \\right \\|$, is a measure of the length (a.k.a. the magnitude) of $\\textbf{u}$. There are multiple possible norms, but the most common one (and the only one we will discuss here) is the Euclidian norm, which is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\left \\Vert \\textbf{u} \\right \\| = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i}{\\textbf{u}_i}^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "We could implement this easily in pure python, recalling that $\\sqrt x = x^{\\frac{1}{2}}$"
