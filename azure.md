### [Cloud benefits and considerations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/fundamental-azure-concepts/benefits-of-cloud-computing)
* High availability
* Scalability
* Elasticity
* Agility
* Geo-distribution
* Disaster recovery

* Lower operating cost
* Run infra more efficiently
* Scale as business needs change
* Limitless pool of raw compute, storage and networking components
* Cognitive services, Analytics services

### Core architectural components
* Management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, resources, resource manager, [management groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/azure-architecture-fundamentals/management-groups-subscriptions).
* Regions, Availability zones, (Zonal services, Zone-redundant services, Non-regional services), region pairs.
* Subscriptions: billing boundary, access control boundary. Environments, organizational structures, billing, 

### [Azure services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-azure-fundamentals/tour-of-azure-services)
* Compute
* Networking
* Storage
* Mobile
* Databases
* Web
* IoT (Internet of Things)
* Big data
* AI
* DevOps

### [Azure compute services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/azure-compute-fundamentals/overview)
* VMs, container instances, app services, functions (serverless computing)
* VM scale sets: create and manage a group of identical, load-balanced VMs
* Azure Batch: enables large-scale parallel and high-performance computing (HPC) batch jobs with the ability to scale to tens, hundreds, or thousands of VMs.
* VM virtualize hardwares, contrainers virtualize OS. 
* Serverless. Benefits: no infra management, scalability, only pay for what you use. Abstraction of servers, event-driven scale, micro-billing.
* Azure functions (stateless, statefull-Durable functions); logic apps execute workflows that are designed to automate business scenarios and are built from predefined logic blocks.
