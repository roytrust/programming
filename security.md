# OAuth2, OpenID Connect
* 
### OAuth2
* Allows a user to authorize one application (a client), to send a request to an API (resource server), on the user's behalf to retrieve data at the resource server owned by the user. The application interacts with an authorization server which authenticates a user as part of obtaining their consent for the application to access their resources.

### OpenID Connect (OIDC)
* A layer on top of the OAuth2 to provide information in a standard format to applications about the idenity of an authenticated user. This provided a solution for applications for user authentication as well as API authorization.



### SAML2 - Federated Identity - Security Assertion Markup Language
* IdP (identity provider), identity federation
