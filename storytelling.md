## Overview
* exploratory vs. explanatory analysis
* the qwest, the problem -> the protagonist's gameplan, the solution -> the toolkit, the raw data.
* UI design pattern
* preattentive attributes, iconic memory

## Storytelling with data
* Understand the context
* Choose an appropriate visual display
* Eliminate clutter
* Focus attention where you want it
* Think like a designer
* Tell a story

* plot: what context is essential? Twists: what is interesting about the data and what it shows? Ending: what do you want your audience to do?

### the importance of context
Rather, before you begin down the path of creating a data visualization or communication, attention and time should be paid to understanding the **context** for the need to communicate.
* exploratory vs. explanatory analysis
* who, what, how
* what: action, mechanism, tone
* 3 minutes story
* big idea: 1. It must articulate your unique point of view; 2. It must convey what's at stake; and 3. It must be a comple statement.

### choosing an effective visual
* Simple text. A numer or 2
* Tables. The data should be what stands out, not the borders.
* Heatmap. Color saturation to provide visual cues. Legend: low-high subtitle.
* Scatterplot, points. Relationship between 2 things
* Lines. Continuous data
* Line graph. Series of data. Show range
* Slopegraph. Two time periods or points of comparison and want to show relative increases and decreases or differences across various categories between the two data points. Emphasize a single series. http://storytellingwithdata.com/slopegraph-template
* Bars. Categorical data. Zero baseline. Data label inside. waterfall charts.
* horizontal bar chart. Stacked h-bar: portions of a whole on a scale from negative to positive.
* Avoid: pie, donut, 3D, secondary y-axes

### Clutter is your enemy
* Cognitive load. Data-ink, signal-to-noise ratio
* Gestalt principles of visual perception. 
Tend to think as related or belonging to part of a group.
  * Proximity. Physically close together.
  * Similarity. Similar color, shape or orientation.
  * Enclosure. Physically enclosed together.
  * Closure. Perceive a set of individual elements as a single recognizable shape when they can - when parts of a whole are missing, our eyes fill in the gap.
  * Continuity. Our eyes seek the smoothest path and naturally create continuity in what we see even where it may not explicitly exist.
  * Connection. Stronger than similarity. Less than enclosure, but depends.
* Lack of visual order
* Alignment. Top left to z shape. Avoid Diagonal components.
* White space. As pause in public speaking. 
* Non-strategic use of contrast
* Some elements should always be retained with numbers, including dollar signs, percent signs, and commas in large numbers.
* Decluttering
  * remove chart border
  * remove gridlines
  * remove data markers
  * clean up axis labels
  * label data directly
  * leverage consistent color

### Focus your audience's attention
* Test: where are your eyes drawn?
* Memory. 
  * Iconic memory.
  * Short-term memory: poeple can keep about 4 chunks of visual info. 
  * long-term memory. For pattern recognition and general cognitive processing. Aggregate of visual and verbal memory.
* Preattentive attributes signal where to look. 
  * Enable our audience to see what we want them to see before they even know they are seeing it.
  * orientation, Shape, line length, line width, size, curvatue, added marks, enclosure, hue, intensity, spatial position, motion. 
  * We used sparingly preattentive attributes can be extremely useful for doing 2 things: 1) drawing your audience's attention quickly to where you want them to look, and 2) Creating a visual hierarchy of information. 
* Preattentive attributes in text. Bold, color, italics, size, separate spatially, outline, underline
* Preattentive attributes in graphs.
* start by pushing everything to the backgroud
* Color. Use sparsingly, strategically, consistently. Blue. Colorblind: blue positive, orange neg. Tone that color conveys, connotation.

### Think like a designer
#### Affordance
* Highlight the important stuff. 
  * At most 10% of visual design be highlighted.
  * Universal principles of design.

* Eliminate distractions. 
The decision of what to cut or de-emphasize can be even more important than what to include or highlight.
  * Not all data are equally important.
  * When detail isn't needed, summarize.
  * Ask yourself: would eliminating this change anything?
  * Push necessary, but non-message-impacting items to the backgroud.

* Create a clear visual hierarchy of information
  * The power of super-categories

#### Accessibility
* Don't overcomplicate
  * Make it legible
  * Keep it clean
  * Use straightforward language
  * Remove unnecessary complexity
* Text is your friends
  * Use it to label, introduce, explain, reinforce, highlight, recommend and tell a story
  * Action titles on slides

#### Aesthetics
* Be smart with color
* Pay attention to alignment
* Leverage white space

#### Acceptance
* Articulate the benefits of the new or different approach.
* Show the side-by-side
* Provide multiple options and seek input
* Get a vocal member of your audience on board

### Dissecting model visuals
* Line graph
* Annotated line graph with forecast
* 100% Stacked bars
* Leveraging positive and negative stacked bars
* Horizontal stacked bars

### Lessons in storytelling
* The three-act structure. The conflict and tension are an integral part of story.
* Beginning (plot), middle (twists), and end (call to action)
* Stories unite an idea with an emotion, arouse the audience's attention and energy.
* A story expresses how and why life changes.
#### Storytelling and the written word
* How to write with style. Kurt Vonnegut
* Find a subject you care about.
* Do not ramble, though.
* Keep it simple.
* The guts to cut.
* Sound like myself.
* Say what you meant to say.
* Pity the reader.
#### Constructing the story
Story is what ties together information, giving our presentation or communication, a framework for our audience to follow.
* The beginning. Tension: The conflict between what is and what could be.
* The middle. Write headlines first.
* The end. Call to action
#### The narrative structure
* Narrative flow: The order of your story.
* The speaking and writing narrative.
* The power of repetition. Intro, content, conclusion
#### Tactics to help ensure that your story is clear.
* Horizontal logic. Read just the slide title of each slide throughout your deck and, together, These snippets tell the overarching story you want to communicate. Action title
* Vertical logic. All information on a given slide is self reinforcing.
* Reverse storyboarding.
* A fresh perspective.

### Pulling it all together

### Case studies
* Color considerations with a dark background
* Leveraging animation in the visuals you present
* Establishing logic in order
* Strategies for avoiding the spaghetti graph
* Alternatives to pie charts


## Data story teller
* connect with people's experience
* focus on one idea
* keep it simple
* explore the things you know best
* make an impact
