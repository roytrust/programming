# Agile
* Explain **whay & why**
* Coaching


## Coaching
* Coochie is not about fixing people problems; it is about believing in people and helping them grow.
* tean build: conversational turn-taking, ostentatious listening -> psychological safety
* Facilitative skills: emotional intelligence, connecting the dots, active listening, powerful questions, engaging conflict, flexibility
* Elements of EQ
  * Self-awareness: knowing how you feel
  * Self-regulation: managing your emotions
  * Motivation: desire to work toward something
  * Empathy: understanding and sharing the feelings of another
  * Social skills: communicating effectively
* Active listening
  * listen and understand, inquire, summarize what you heard, acknowledge their perspective
  * yes, and

### Ask more open, powerful questions
* open, stimulating, flowing, clear, rooted, non-judgmental
* how, what, why, who/when/where, which/yes-no questions

## Team, soft skills 
* Dysfunctions: lack of trust, fear of conflict (purpue truth), avoidance of accountability, 
* [Eisenhower Matrix](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/eisenhower-matrix) 
* Managers lead by example when it comes to working hours.
* However, managers need to ensure even allocation of work.
* Effective managers maintain large internal networks across their company.
* One-on-ones remain vital
* Lastly, managers are engaged at work, too.

### Delegation framework
* What: what are you delegating?
* Why: to big picture and why them?
* How: any specific requirements? mode of communication?
* What if: any anticipated issues or obstacles?
* What next: how will you follow up and monitor progress?

### Habits 
[7 habits of highly effective people](https://franklincovey.ca/the-7-habits/)
* Be proactive: taking responsibility, responsible, we have the freedom to choose our response. One of the most important things we choose is what we say. On circle of influence.
  * Reactive: blame external sources, reactive language, in the circle of concern. 
* Begin with the end in mind. Mental, physical
* Prioritize, first things first, important things
* Think win-win. Mutual benefit.
* Seek first to understand, then to be understood. Empathetic communication.
* Creative cooperation
* Daily selfhrenewal

# [Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns)
## Design Principle
* __Encapsulate what varies__. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.  
  Take the parts that vary and encapsulate them, so that later you can alter or extend the parts that vary without affecting those that don't.
* __Promgram to an interface__, not an implementation. Program to a supertype.  
  Exploit polymorphism by programming to a supertype so that the actual runtime object isn't locked into the code. 
  "program to a supertype" as "the declared type of the variables should be a supertype, usually an abstract class or interface, so that the objects
  assigned to those variables can be any concrete implementation of the supertype,
  which means the class declaring them doesn't have to know about the actual boject types.
* __Favor composition over inheritance__. HAS-A can be better than IS-A.
  Flexibility: encapsulate a family of algorithms. change behavior at runtime.
* Strive for __loosely coupled designs__ between objects that interact.
* __Open-Closed__: classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
* __Dependency Inversion__: Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concrete classes.
  * No variable should hold a reference to a concrete class.
  * No class should derive from a concrete class.
  * No method should override an implemented method of any of its base classes.


## Concepts
* __algorithm__ always defines a clear set of actions that can achieve some goal, a __pattern__ is a more high-level description of a solution. algorithm is a cooking recipe, a pattern is more like a blueprint.
* Patterns aren't invented, they are discovered.
* OO Basics: abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance.

## Creational Patterns
### Abstract Factory
Produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### [Factory Method](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method)
Defines an interface for creating an objects but let subclasses to decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclass.

## Behavioral Patterns
### [Strategy](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy)
* Define a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
* __context__ must have a field for storing a reference to one of the strategies. The context delegates the work to a linked strategy object instead of executing it on its own.
* __client__ passes the desired strategy to the context. In fact, the context doesnâ€™t know much about strategies. It works with all strategies through the same generic interface, which only exposes a single method for triggering the algorithm encapsulated within the selected strategy.
* This way the context becomes independent of concrete strategies, so you can add new algorithms or modify existing ones without changing the code of the context or other strategies.

### [Observer](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/observer)
* Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically. Subject, observer.
* 

### Template Method
defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

## Structural Patterns
### [Decorator](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/decorator)
* Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically, by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending fucntionality.
