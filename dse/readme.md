* Data **visualization** makes it easier to identify trends, patterns, and outliers and to discover insights within complex data. 
  Information displayed in a visual context, such as a graph or a map, is a more natural way for the human mind to compreshend large amounts of data.

### Data Sampling
* **Bernoulli sampling**
* Fixed-Size sampling based on a specific number of rows. 
* Fraction-Based sampling based on probability.
